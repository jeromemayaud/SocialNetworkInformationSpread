# SocialNetworkInformationSpread

A model to simulate the spread of information through social networks, as described in Hu et al. (2017) and Young et al. (2020).

Three models are presented:



fname = 'socialnetworkfile.txt'
pl_fname = 'peerleadersfile.txt'
convert_fname = 'confirmedconversationsfile.txt'
nc_fname = 'noconversationsfile.txt'
all_nodes_fname = 'allnodesfile.txt'
