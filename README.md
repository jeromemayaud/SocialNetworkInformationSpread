# SocialNetworkInformationSpread

A model to simulate the spread of information through social networks, as described in Hu et al. (2017) and Young et al. (2020).

This repository contains the code for three infusion diffusion models:

- "Activation Jump Model" (AJM)
- "Independent Cascade Model" (ICM)
- 'Linear Threshold Model" (LTM)

For all models, the main inpute files are:

fname = A .txt file of all social ties between every single node in the group

pl_fname = A .txt file of all the designate Peer Leaders in the group

convert_fname = 
nc_fname = 'noconversationsfile.txt'
all_nodes_fname = 'allnodesfile.txt'
